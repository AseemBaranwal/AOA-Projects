# AOA-Projects
This repository was created to facilitate collaboration and easy code maintenance for the different projects as given by Professor Alper Ungor. These projects were created to gain a deep-understanding for the COT-5405 Analysis of Algorithms course at University of Florida. I was accompanied by my teammate Devanshu Singh who was an active contributor to this repository.
